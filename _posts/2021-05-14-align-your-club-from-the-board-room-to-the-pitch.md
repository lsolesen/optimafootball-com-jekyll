As my consultancy company **Optima Football** has researched and analysed in previous years; football club's often lack a long term strategic plan and as well miss the connection between the board room and the pitch.

It is only with these crucial elements in place that a club can grow sustainable and over time perform towards its maximum potential (budget - competences - continuity).

At **Al Jazira Club**, I'm privileged to work under a very professional board and through a clear vision that we have described into our club strategy. Therefore, this statement below from our chairman is a great proof of our club alignment after we won the Arabian Gulf League title 2020/2021 earlier this week:
