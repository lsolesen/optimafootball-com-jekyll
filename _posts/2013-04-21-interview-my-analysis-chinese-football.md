I was interviewed by Kenneth Cortsen - Ph.D-Researcher & Business Development Strategist, Master of Science in Business Economics & MBA with focus on sport economics, sport management, and sport marketing - about my work in China and the development of Chinese football. In the interview, I'm asked regarding the youth system in China, the David Beckham effect, and the future of Chinese football.
