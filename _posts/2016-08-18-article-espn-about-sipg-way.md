In the beginning of 2016, I helped our club create 'THE SIPG WAY' - a talent development strategy, so we all work in the same direction and focus on the player from U23 and down and **only** the development of the players.

We have already taken some proactive steps and one of them in the near future can also be to sent young players to Europe for a period to optimize the development out of the comform zone.

I had a chat with ESPN and journalist John Duerden about this (in English):
