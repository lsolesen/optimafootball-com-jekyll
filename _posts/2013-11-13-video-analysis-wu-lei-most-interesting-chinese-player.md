In our serie the "CSL-Round Up", I have analyzed Wu Lei and showed how a scouting model can be builded as well. This is something new in China, so hopefully a lot of clubs can work more structured and detailed in their scouting and finding the perfect players for their set up in the future. That is one of my goals of presenting these videos in China to help raise the level.
