In the Danish newspaper Information, we can read an interesting study about elite athletes and their motivation to work hard 365 days in many years. The study is not rocket science, but these studies are relevant to confirm our knowledge and methods in the daily training as an elite coach. Remember - we can always improve and get better.

One thing was very interesting for me in the study: For many years, us coaches have been aware on reaching the 10.000 hours of training to perfection (from Anders Ericsson's famous study in Berlin), but maybe we ask the wrong question? We shall not only look for the 10.000 hours, but instead try to create a motivation and an environment where the athletes will do the 10.000 hours.

Very interesting debate - read more here (on Danish):
