We are already far into our pre-season with both the 1. team and the Development Squad and in general the 2016 season will be very interesting for us in Shanghai SIPG F.C.

For the first time in the history of the club; we will compete in the Asian Champions League, which will kick off on February 24th in Melbourne if we manage to win our crucial qualification match on February 9th. Therefore, it's a 2016-season with a lot of challenges and for me also working a lot with our Development Squad - the key is to continue getting players ready for the 1. team by keep improving our training culture and the general daily work with the youngsters.

The first player from our 1997-group of talents look to be close to the 1. team this year, so this is a good sign & signal for the rest of the Development Squad that we are opening doors and if they work hard and dedicated - they will get the chance.

I spoke to a Danish media recently about our season (in Danish):
