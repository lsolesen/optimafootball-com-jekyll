During my very short trip to Denmark last week to follow my UEFA Pro license coaching course, I had to wait half a day for the next flight to Shanghai, so I was glad to be invited to the new radio football podcast at Danish media Politiken to discuss several football related topics with among others my former boss and Director of Sports at Brondby IF, Ole Bjur.

You can hear the football podcast down below or get it at Itunes (in Danish):
