This past week, I was invited to the Danish media, Mediano, to discuss modern football tendencies along side the Technical Director of FCN, Flemming Pedersen, who is one of the best coaches in Denmark, if you ask me, & I actually play under Flemming many years ago, so I know what I'm talking about.

You can hear the podcast in the link down below (in Danish):
