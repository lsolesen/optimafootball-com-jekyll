In general, I believe you need a strategy for most things in life to control, evaluate, and succeed whatever you are doing or handling.

Through my 5 years abroad in China, I have developed my own 'cultural intelligence strategy'. This is based on my personal experiences and mini-research on the topic.

Down below are two articles with my words related to how to succeed abroad or in a different environment & culture:

\*Adapt or adjust?

\*Respect or force?

\*Accept or change?

  
**My cultural intelligence philosophy:**  
“You have 0 % chance of succeeding without adjusting, respecting and accepting the culture of the country, business and/or organization (club), you work for / in”
