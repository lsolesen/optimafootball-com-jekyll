Everyone with interest in Elite sport and talent development should watch this fantastic documentary about the Swedish athlete Carolina Klüft.

It shows a honest picture of a hard life style with no room for mistakes or failure. She trained because she loved it, but it became a curse because she was so talented that everyone expected her to win every single time. Really inspiring to learn about and see the picture from the inside of the athlete.

Watch it here - it is on Swedish!
