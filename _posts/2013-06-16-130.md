In these three interviews, I tell famous Danish football magazine, Tipsbladet, website onside.dk, and a local Danish paper about my current job situation.

»I have turned down an offer from the Middle East and keep my main focus on China now. I have two interesting possibilities here in China Mainland, so I hope to know more in 7-10 days, but you never know for sure in the World of football.«
