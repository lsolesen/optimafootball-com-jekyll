For two years, I have been living in Mainland China, and it has been and still is a fantastic journey. I've learned so much about culture, people, myself and the World. I can only advice people to get out of their comfort zone and try going abroad - you get so much in return in the end.

In this radio interview with Susan Salzbrenner from Fita Cross Cultures, I get the chance to discuss some of the many aspects in my life in China so far.
