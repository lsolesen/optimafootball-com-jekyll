I love inspiration in my daily life and motivation is my patch to work hard every day. I love my life when I wake up in the morning and again at the end of day - that's my key to a good life - a constant development and motivation. Down below is a couple of links to some sites which provided me with some new knowledge and created new motivation. The first one is on Danish - enjoy!



https://blivinspireret.dk/ - An inspiration site on Danish - great idea!



https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikaandersen/2012/01/18/why-top-talent-leaves-top-10-reasons-boiled-down-to-1/ - Forbes about talents and their lack of motivation - very interesting.
