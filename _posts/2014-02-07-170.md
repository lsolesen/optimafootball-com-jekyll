In January, I started attending the UEFA PRO-license coaching course in Copenhagen, Denmark at the Danish FA (DBU). This is the last step in the international coaching course model, so it's a big pleasure for me to attend this course in a top environment learning from good coaches.

I'm obviously the one in the course coming from most distance from mainland China, so in relation to that fact, the Danish FA asked me for an interview, which you can read down below (in Danish):
