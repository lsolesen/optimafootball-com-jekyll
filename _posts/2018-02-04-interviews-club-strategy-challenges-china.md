I did a couple of interviews this past weeks. One regarding our club strategy and focus on youth development and one with a Danish radio show called "Kina-snak" (China-talk) on my nearly six years living and working in China as well as operating in a different environment and culture.

  
The interview on our football strategy can be found here (in English and Portugese): [https://futinasia.wordpress.com/2018/02/02/shanghai-sipg-playing-today-looking-at-the-future/](https://futinasia.wordpress.com/2018/02/02/shanghai-sipg-playing-today-looking-at-the-future/)

  
And the Danish radio show is in this link (obviously in Danish): [https://www.radio24syv.dk/programmer/kina-snak/21260727/kinas-fodboldrevolution-og-arven-fra-alibaba](https://www.radio24syv.dk/programmer/kina-snak/21260727/kinas-fodboldrevolution-og-arven-fra-alibaba)
