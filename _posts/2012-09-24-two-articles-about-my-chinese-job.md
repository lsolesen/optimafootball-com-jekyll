In these two articles myself and Ebbe Sand talks about our Academy and why we are trying to build up the football in China.

»My mission is to explore the football in China and give the young talent the best football education in the country at Ebbe Sand Soccer Academy and in time, we shall produce players for the Chinese Super League and later on in Europe. The Chinese kids need a role model right now in the football world, and our end goal is to develop players good enough for one of the big clubs in Europe«, says Academy Director Mads Davidsen.
