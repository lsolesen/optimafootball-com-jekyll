I’m very pleased and excited to announce the next chapter of my career as I have signed with Al Jazira Club (UAE) becoming Director of Football.

In this future project I’ll be working closely together with Al Jazira aiming to build a sustainable club based on the concept and model from Optima Football.

Our vision is not only to be developing the best players of the region, but also to be competing at the highest level throughout Asia.

A great challenge professionally and personally lies ahead of me and us as a family.
