It's a big step and a massive day for our young club, Shanghai SIPG F.C. when our General Manager, Mr. Sui, today announced the signing of the Brazilian top player 'Hulk'.

We had a press conference at our team hotel to annouce this big signing which is not only a great addition for our squad, but also for the entire league and interest of Chinese football in the global market.

As part of the recruitment process & transfer strategy of the club; It's a great feeling to have helped secured the player we really wanted and now feeling the excitement to see Hulk help our club forward, I really look forward to the cooperation.

The Danish newspaper 'Ekstra Bladet' made a story about us signing Hulk and you can read in the link down below (in Danish):
