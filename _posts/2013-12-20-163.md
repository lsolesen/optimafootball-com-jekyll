This past week, I was invited to join the football radio program on Danish radio station 24-7, "Fodbold FM". It was a very interesting debate regarding international football, scouting, the development of Chinese football, and other interesting topics.

**Hear the entire program here - both part of the the show is 60 minutes and in Danish:**
