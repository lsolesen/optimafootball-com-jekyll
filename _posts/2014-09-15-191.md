This past week, I got an invitation to join the Danish football radio show, "Fodbold FM", where we discuss football for 2 hours live in the radio at channel 24/7. This time, we had an interesting look at the Danish national team and the future for Danish football.

**You can hear the podcast here (in Danish):**
