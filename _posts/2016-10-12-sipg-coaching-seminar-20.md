This past week, I hosted the Shanghai SIPG Coaching Seminar 2.0. We had all our youth coaches in Shanghai for 2-days moving into 'phase 2' of THE SIPG WAY - our club football philosophy & now we try to build a training and coaching methodology through out the club.

For me; this is the **only** way to succeed (over time) in modern football and our Academy-side is looking more and more interesting.

I'm also pleased to have brought in assistance as the Danish performance and top football coach, Carsten Dohm, has signed a contract with us as our Technical Consultant to help me setting up the methodology and educate our youth coaches in our club philosophy.

In 2017 we will arrange four more 'SIPG coaching seminars', and I can't wait to keep moving forward on this crucial club aspect & help Chinese football move into a more bright future!
