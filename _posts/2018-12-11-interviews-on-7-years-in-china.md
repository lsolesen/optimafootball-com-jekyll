I have been asked to do several interviews in the past weeks in Denmark as I'm home for my holiday.

The themes of the interview are various, but mainly about my experience in China and Chinese football, which has come to an end after nearly 7 years out in the far east.

One interview is with the sports media brand 'Mediano' while the other interview is at a radio show at 24/7.

Both podcasts are in Danish:
