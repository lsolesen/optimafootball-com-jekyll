A few weeks back, I had a visit from the English BBC World News making a story about the development in Chinese football. They visited me and my Shanghai SIPG F.C. Development Squad at the training ground to get an insight-story on the progress we are making.

They also interviewed our Head Coach, Sven Goran Eriksson, among other 'pioneers' working and helping Chinese football forward.

The story is now online on various platforms, but one article can be found here:
