In these two interviews with the Danish media, I tell the press that I'm considering two new offers from China and the Middle East.

«I want to stay abroad and continue my development here, so I will in the coming weeks make my decision regarding the future. I'm really happy to live abroad and I would like to see and recommand more Danish coaches taking the chance and moving away from Denmark», says Mads Davidsen.
