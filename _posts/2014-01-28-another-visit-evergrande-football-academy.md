Today I made a visit for the second time at the Evergrande Football Academy about 75km from down town Guangzhou. Even I work for the rival club of the city, I have to make a mark for this amazing place.

2300 players / students and some almost unrealistic facilities. This is a huge step for the development of Chinese football as an Academy like this not only develops 11 top players, but focus on the grass roots as well, which is the key to a better elite in the long run. Also some Spanish coaches from Real Madrid is there in the first years to make sure that the philosophy is the right one, so this place has a great potential.

At the same time today - an article is written in Financial Times, so please read this very interesting article about the fantastic Guangzhou Evergrande Youth Academy:
