<p>How to comprehend 11 years abroad across various countries, cultures, roles, life changing moments, expanding network and personal development? What a ride! As a family we have loved this way of living learning about the world developing an individual career leading to unique experiences.</p>

<p>The international urban vibe in Shanghai, the tropical climate and more ‘wild living’ in Guangzhou, the hectic and busy life across China. A China turned upside down when Xi Jinping came along. So many helpful and humble people with proud family traditions taking good care of the elderly. From north to south to east to west. From noodles to sweets to spicy to sour. China offers so many flavors and diversity.</p>

<p>The amazing time in west London with daily walks in Hyde Park, while Brexit was the hot topic, international network, interesting discussions and being in the ‘center of football’. Sunday Roast and Premier League in the weekends.</p>

<p>The relaxed Spanish life style, the 300 sunny days a year, the beach being our garden, the morning coffee view The Mediterranean Sea. The mountains just around the other corner. The barren landscape.</p>

<p>The Middle Eastern culture, conservatism, desert, a young country, extreme weather, sandstorms. Lebanese salads and late afternoon walks in 45 degrees while the mosques started to ‘sing’. A feeling difficult to explain. Religion as a central part of living and understanding the world.</p>

<p>I feel rich in experiences!</p>

<p>And I’m privileged to continue my career across the world together with Right To Dream. <a href="/daily-life/joining-right-to-dream-as-group-head-of-football/">Read more here</a>.</p>

<p>I think my humble advise would be: Do it! Go ahead. Explore. Lean. Grow. Keep an open mindset and be curious. The world is a very complex place. Don’t judge others. Try to understand others with their perspective at eye. We can all learn from each other if we bring the right mindset when exploring.</p>

<p>Step by step learning and understanding bits and parts of the world’s complexity…</p>]]></content><author><name>Mads Davidsen</name></author><category term="Daily life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[2012-2023: The end of an era]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Joining Right To Dream - as Group Head of Football</title><link href="https://optimafootball.com/daily-life/joining-right-to-dream-as-group-head-of-football/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Joining Right To Dream - as Group Head of Football" /><published>2022-12-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-12-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://optimafootball.com/daily-life/joining-right-to-dream-as-group-head-of-football</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://optimafootball.com/daily-life/joining-right-to-dream-as-group-head-of-football/"><![CDATA[<p>I’m excited to announce the next journey in my career as I have joined the very proactive, forward thinking organisation ‘Right to Dream’ (RTD) as Group Head of Football.</p>

<p>I will help design and oversee a global football strategy aligning the RTD-units across Ghana, Denmark, Egypt and USA. To create opportunities and shape environments for young people, upcoming generations across the globe build huge motivation in me and I can’t wait getting started - which I already am - currently sitting in our academy in Cairo, Egypt: Everyone has the ‘Right To Dream’.</p>

<p>Due to a ‘family situation’ our current way of living abroad moving around the globe has to end. Luckily, we find a lot of meaning, value, and excitement in the new path which means returning to Denmark as a family (in the near future) after more than 10 years abroad!</p>

<p>We will see you all out there!</p>

<p>We are free and can move where ever - whenever. The feeling of freedom and at the same time the privilege of having (job) options on different continents makes it a perfect time to reflect and thinking forward.</p>

<p>What is the good life (for us)?</p>

<p>What kind of life do you wish to live?</p>

<p>What sacrifices are you willing to make?</p>

<p>What’s the <strong>career - family</strong> balance worth in the different ends?</p>

<p>What’s the pro’s and con’s in the different options?</p>

<p>Where do you want your kids to grow up?</p>

<p>There are so many variables in play, but of course family comes first, so overall we have to reflect in the coming weeks and then make the plan for the next step in our life.</p>]]></content><author><name>Mads Davidsen</name></author><category term="Daily life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[While enjoying my holiday from (mostly) sunny Denmark, it’s an interesting period in our life leaving Al Jazira Club and the UAE.]]></summary></entry></feed>
