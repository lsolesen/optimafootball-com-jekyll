      title: "How hard can it be?"
      excerpt: "Most football fans have probably asked themselves this question (How hard can it be?) when they watch their team lose several games in a row, or when the club pays an excessive price for an ageing attacker, or when the club hands in another bleeding annual report. The answer is that it is extremely hard to run a football club. Football is complex, relational and brutally competitive on the field. And outside the field it is even more complicated. Unfortunately, many decision makers in football are emotionally biased by a range of stressors that challenge their sense of rationale and time. The logic consequence is that they over estimate in the short run and under-analyze in the long haul. A football strategic book to inspire the industry."
